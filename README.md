âœ¨ I'm a full time student and program things in my free time. I'm passionate about building and contributing to open-source projects.

âš¡ My main focuses are JavaScript (nodejs), Java and Lua. I know a couple of other programming languages, though not very well. I also love documenting things (markdown is my city).
