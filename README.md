I'm a student and program things in my free time. I'm passionate about creating and contributing to open-source projects. My main focuses are JavaScript (browsers + [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)) and Lua. I also love documenting things (because I love markdown).

Here's a breakdown of projects I've helped with, at or created:
- [DISBOARD](https://disboard.org/): Moderation, support and internationalization
- [Studesh](https://studesh.com/): Front- and back-end
- [Bedocker](https://bedocker.com/): Front- and back-end
- [Greenville Realism](https://discord.com/invite/S2tJn4wsew): Bot development (with [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/)), community management and growth
- [Rensselaer County](https://www.roblox.com/games/4637668954/): Scripting
